Instructions:

- files "speech_man.wav" and "speech_woman.wav" contain a sentence spoken by a male and female individual
- files "synt_speech_man.wav" and "synt_speech_woman.wav" contain the resulting synthesized sentences obtain via Linear Predictive Coding
- file "morphed_sentence_interp" contain some samples of the morphed speech signal (from female to male voice) obtained via Finsler geodesic path according to the method discussed in the above reference
